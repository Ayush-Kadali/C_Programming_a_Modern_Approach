# Solution for Exercise 06

## Question

Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than one adjacent underscore (as in current__balance, for examplpe)?

## Solution 

> Two or more adjacent underscore can be hard to decipher the no. of underscores and while writting the indentifier next time there is a much higher chance to make a typo. Also it would be hard to read the code if one identifier has one underscore and another has two.
